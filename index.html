        <pre class="aboutP" id="About">

            We are a local, family based company with 20+ years of experience. Ross and Georgia are skilled in
            all aspects of remodeling and construction with a high attention to detail and execution.

            We have spent many years working in the construction industry, both for ourselves and for other
            companies. We have chosen to open in North Idaho to meet the needs of our local community where
            we have full control over the quality of product, and the final results all for a better customer
            service experience.

            What we want is for our clients to be more then just a customer, we want to build relationships for life with them.

            We serve all of Kootenai County and North Idaho with open arms.

            Another goal we have is to build a legacy for our children. To provide them with life skills to be able to succeed
            and inherit a strong client based company.
